<p class="mt-2 mb-3"><i>I have gone through the suggestions I have made to my friends visiting Dubai for the last 6 months, and this is a comprehensive guide I could come up with.</i></p>

<p></p>

<p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="1.0s"><span class="firstcharacter">D</span>ubai has become my second home. With work, I get to visit the city almost every other month&#8202;—&#8202;and typically spend one week to 10 days. And let’s just say that I could never get bored of this city.</p>

<p>Known for its glamorous lifestyle entailing fancy restaurants and high-end shopping destinations, Dubai is often largely left undiscovered by new visitors. The fact that Dubai offers a plethora of inexpensive activities&#8202;—&#8202;to connect with and appreciate the local scene&#8202;—&#8202;is usually overlooked amid grand skyscrapers and malls.</p>

</div>


<p>We also tend to forget that Dubai is a city of a melting pot. And there is nothing better than discovering affordable traditional cuisines to get a taste of diverse cultures. You can start with traditional foods of the UAE, which contain multiple spices and ingredients namely, fish, meat (usually from sheep or goats) and rice. Throughout the year you can also find camel meat in hot dogs, burgers and even pizza.</p>

<p>It is easy to get overwhelmed by the city’s grandeur as a tourist visiting Dubai for the first time. Hence, we have prepared the following list of activities and cheap eats (go directly to the next section if you want to skip to cheap eats) to make your visit as worthwhile as possible while staying within the budget.</p>

<h3>1. Late night snooker at Dubai Snooker Club</h3>

<p>For an authentic experience that can stretch well into the early hours of the morning, head to the Dubai Snooker Club, an old-school hangout that has been in Dubai for more than 30 years. If you have set your sights on becoming the next Ronnie O’Sullivan there is a 100&#8202;—&#8202;seater viewing gallery for when your skills draw a crowd and you can get an incredible 360-degree view of Dubai from the roof.</p>

<p><i><a href="http://www.dubaisnooker.com" target="_blank">www.dubaisnooker.com</a></i></p>

<h3>2. Discover the thrill of night crab hunting </h3>

<p>Explore the beauty of illuminated mangroves and discover the thrill of night crab hunting at the Flamingo Beach Resort, Umm Al Quwain. Skilled guides, on glass bottom boats, will ferry you to natural mangroves where the low tide water is lit by underwater lights and suitable for all ages. Once you have your catch you can enjoy a barbecue buffet of fresh crab along the shore.</p>

<p>Night crab hunting is a popular marine sport enjoyed by the locals of Umm Al Quwain and this Northern region of the UAE is the only place where mangrove formations are found.</p>

</div>
</div>


<h3>3. Dubai Garden Glow </h3>

<p>With more than 30 glow-in-the-dark installations created by 150 artists and spread across 40 acres of park, Dubai’s Glow Garden is a favorite spot to be appreciated after dark. Some of the highlights include the Ice Park which, in creative contrast to the desert heat, houses the work of talented artists who have produced a stunning assembly of ice sculptures.</p>

<p>The Glow Park has been categorized into Seasons and each season has an inspiration which has included; Wonders of the World (S1) and A Tribute to Nature (S2). Designed for both residents and tourists the Glow Park is a popular exhibition whilst conveying strong messages on preservation and energy saving.</p>

<h3>4. The Night Souk on Deira Island</h3>

<p>There is nothing quite like shopping in a bustling local market after dark. At Dubai’s exciting souks you can shop for Gold Jewellery, hand-woven fabrics, and traditional oud fragrances and though the city has a reputation as a modern metropolis, traditional Arabian markets are still an important part of daily life and trade.</p>

<p>The new Night Souk on Deira Islands will soon become one of the biggest hotspots in Dubai. A modern twist on the traditional Arabic souk, the market will be home to over 5,000 shops and 96 quayside cafes and restaurants and will be one of several new attractions at Deira Islands, located on the South Island just across from mainland Dubai.</p>

<h3>5. Mint Tea & Shisha</h3>

<p>Not necessarily on your Bucket List but a must try (at least once) in Dubai is smoking Shisha. It is the preferred pastime of the young and old and there are lots of flavors to tempt you. There are many Shisha Lounges (Hookah Bars) in Dubai but try <a href="https://shakespeare-and-co.com/" target="_blank">Shakespeare Café</a> as the last stop of the evening for mint tea and shisha. Popular with the locals with great sofas and soft lights it is a great chill-out place to end a night out.</p>

<div class="text-center img-caption">Via <a href="https://www.barastibeach.com/" target="_blank">Barasti Beach Official Website</a></div>
</div>
</div>


<h3>6. Barasti Beach Bar</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.barastibeach.com" target="_blank">Barasti Beach Bar</a> is world famous and has always been one of Dubai's most vibrant bars. Located at the <a href="http://www.booking.com/hotel/ae/le-meridien-mina-seyahi-beach-resort-marina.html?aid=850069" target="_blank">Le Meridian Mina Seyahi Beach Resort Hotel</a> it boasts a huge outdoor seating area, Dubai's best live sporting screen and is a great place to watch sport with a cool drink (alcohol is served) or relax on the comfy sofas on the beach.</p>

<p>Thursday and Friday nights are busy as that’s the weekend in Dubai so you may need to queue. Splitting a large group into couples would be a good move as they often don’t let groups of guys in.</p>

<h3>7. Watch the sunset at the top of Burj Khalifa</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.getyourguide.co.uk/dubai-l173/burj-khalifa-ticket-t161394/?referrer_view_id=11bd472ca77b361cf215b6cd4c09642c&amp;referrer_view_position=4" target="_blank">Burj Khalifa</a> in Dubai is the world’s tallest building. Developed by Dubai-based Emaar Properties it is described both as a "Vertical City" and a "Living Wonder"</p>

<p>Catching sunset at the top of Burj Khalifa is not to be missed. Just being elevated up 125 floors is amazing but watching the sunset over the Arabian Gulf from 2,717 ft with a 360-degree view is truly spectacular.</p>

<p>Once the sun has set head to the adjacent <a href="https://www.dubai-online.com/maps/downtown-dubai/" target="_blank">Burj Khalifa Lake</a> and watch the world’s largest musical fountain shoot illuminated water up to 150 meters in harmony to the music. The display is free and evening shows begin at 6.00 pm and repeat every 30 minutes until 11.00 pm</p>

<div class="text-center img-caption">Via Facebook | The Farm, Al Barari</div>
</div>
</div>

<h3>8. The Farm at Al Barari</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.thefarmdubai.ae" target="_blank">The Farm</a> is located inside the Al Barari Estates and as you enter you will be transported into a lush tropical oasis where you can dine in a romantic tranquil garden.</p>

<p>Off the beaten track, in the historic Old Town Occoquan, and a real treat for nature lovers the café specializes in international cuisine but during lunch and dinner their resident Thai Chef will cook up some authentic and delicious Thai food.</p>

<h3>9. Ski Dubai</h3>

<p>Its Dubai during the summer. After a few days there, you would probably look for something "cooler". Hit the slopes and get a few hours respite from the desert climate at the Indoor Ski Resort located at the Emirates Mall.</p>

<p>Typically open until 11.00 pm, <a href="https://www.skidxb.com/" target="_blank">Ski Dubai</a> spans an impressive 242,187 sq. ft. comprising five runs, an indoor black run, beginner slopes, freestyle zone, all covered in real snow year-round.</p>

<p>Even if it's your first time ever on a Ski slope, don’t worry. They have regular classes multiple times while they are open. Hey, it would be cool to brag to your friends on how you picked up skiing in the most unexpected part of the world ;)</p>

<p>When you have finished skiing go and say hello to the colony of Gentoo and King penguins at one of the <a href="https://www.skidxb.com/snow-penguins" target="_blank">Snow Penguin Shows,</a> a fun and educational experience where you can learn all about penguins and how to protect them in the wild.</p>

<h3>10. Drinks at a Rooftop Terrace</h3>

<p>Make like a local and combine skyscrapers with amazing weather for drinks with a view.</p>

<p>For a chilled evening of tunes attracting everyone from office workers to vacationers, <a href="https://www.irisdubai.com/" target="_blank">The Iris Dubai</a> has a fun vibe that picks up a notch at about 10 pm. Located on the 27th Floor of The Oberoi the open roof and floor-to-ceiling windows mean that you get a birds-eye view of the Downtown District. If you feel like dinner this ultimate rooftop experience offers an award-winning menu.</p>


<div class="section mb-5 mt-5">

<p>Experiencing the cosmopolitan city of Dubai is <strong>definitely not limited to site seeing or physical activities</strong>&#8202;—&#8202;culinary delights of the region may leave you pleasantly surprised.</p>

<p>While the abundance of expensive and fancy restaurants is characteristic of Dubai, the city is equally stocked with budget-friendly traditional cuisines. You can enjoy cultural dishes from the middle east, south Asia and southeast Asia to name a few. We have listed out the top ten cheap eats in Dubai that could undoubtedly give you the thrill of trying out authentic traditional food.</p>

<div class="mb-3 mt-3">
<div class="text-center"><img alt="Bu Qtair Instagram" class="img-fluid mt-3 mb-1" src="images/blog/blog-detail/Bu-Qtair-Instagram.png" />

</div>
</div>


<h3>1. Bu Qtair Café </h3>

<p>A former winner of the Timeout Best Budget Restaurant category this seafood café started out selling only the catch of the day in a ramshackle building in Umm Suqeim.</p>

<p>The Indian Café has since expanded, with both indoor and outdoor seating, a laid-back vibe and a gorgeous setting right on Jumeirah Fishing Harbour. Though in no way a fine dining experience it serves up top-quality, house classics like BBQ Shrimp and fish curry served with rice and roti at a great price.</p>

<h3>2. Al Mallah</h3>

<p>With a reputation as one of Dubai’s best Lebanese restaurants, you can literally drive up, park and give your order to a helpful waiter or (recommended) immerse yourself in the local action, get a table and front row seats to people watching along the 2nd of December Street.</p>

<p>Try the shawarmas and manakeesh or the substantial mixed grill, kofta and flatbread washed down with fresh guava juice.</p>


<h3>3. Firas Sweets</h3>

<p>From Kunafa, the bright orange delight with just the right balance of savory and sweet to Baklava, Firas Sweets has grown from a small sweet shop serving the local community to a leading Arabic sweet company.</p>

<p>Kunafa is best served hot so that the cheese remains deliciously stretchy and this gooey soft cheese sweet, topped with crisp-fried vermicelli soaked in cardamom, rosewater and sugar syrup looks too good to eat.</p>

<p>At Firas, you will find the bakers are happy to let you have some free samples before you decide and once you have made your choice, enjoy with some Turkish coffee.</p>

<h3>4. Ravi Restaurant</h3>

<p>Don't be put off by its kerb side appeal or the shared seating, this Pakistani Restaurant serves quality, authentic food at great prices. Everything on the menu is worth sampling but try the mutton handi, egg fried rice, and tandoori roti or spicy mutton chops&#8202;—&#8202;quality street food meets restaurant experience.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.zomato.com/dubai/ravi-restaurant-al-satwa" target="_blank">https://www.zomato.com/dubai/ravi-restaurant-al-satwa</a></p>

<h3>5. Calicut Paragon</h3>

<p>With budget-friendly prices and rave reviews for its delicious curries, this Indian Restaurant is a bustling stop for a hungry crowd looking for affordable, quality dishes.</p>

<p>The seafood gets star status with crab masala, fruity fish curry or whole pomfret in a spicy rub stealing the show. Biriyani rice is combined with raisins, vegetables, and slow- cooked meat. Spinach pakoras and cheese-stuffed mushrooms are standard side orders.</p>
