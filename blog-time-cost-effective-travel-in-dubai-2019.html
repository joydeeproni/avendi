<h5>Time & Cost Effective Travel in Dubai[2019]</h5>

<p class="mt-2 mb-3"><i>Knowing the efficient way of getting around the city is as crucial as knowing where to go. When in Dubai, you should mix up the transportation option available to you. Also, you have got to try out the game-changing service that was recently introduced in the city.</i></p>

<p></p>

<p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="1.0s"><span class="firstcharacter">D</span>ubai is one of the most visited destinations in the world. From Burj Khalifa to the Dubai Mall, the city is home to multiple tourist attractions. So how exactly can we cover these places in the given time frame?</p>

<p>Considering the modest size of Dubai, the city is more or less accessible with the available modes of transportation. There is a number of commuting options in the likes of metros, buses, taxis, ubers or rental cars that you could select from.</p>


<div class="mb-4 mt-3">
<div class="text-center"><img alt="Metro" class="img-fluid mt-3 mb-1" src="images/blog/blog-detail/metro.jpeg" />
</div>
</div>

<h3>Metro</h3>

<p>My personal favorite in the Metro is the Gold Class cabin; it’s just an amazing experience. Think of it as the first class on a train. Gold Class is usually located at the very front or at the very back depending on the direction. The seats are similar to the ones in the normal cabin, however, it is significantly less crowded even during the rush hours.</p>


<div class="mb-4 mt-4">
<div class="text-center"><img alt="Gold Class Cabin" class="img-fluid mt-3 mb-1" src="images/blog/blog-detail/gold_glass_cabin.jpeg" />
<div class="text-center img-caption">Gold Class Cabin | Photo by <a href="https://www.rta.ae/links/rail/en/about-metro.html" target="_blank">RTA</a></div>
</div>
</div>


<p>I find a seat, make myself comfortable, open up my laptop and work during my commute on the Gold Class. The best part is that most of the seats have a small tray table in front, so I can easily turn on my hotspot and work with no disturbance. In fact, this article was written during my commute in the cabin!</p>

<p>For tourists, trying out Gold Class cabin is a must, especially when you are traveling from Burjuman (Bur Dubai area) to JBR/JLT side. You will enjoy an uninterrupted scene of Dubai, with its buildings, cars, or even a sunset. Yes, Gold Class fare is double the normal fare; but it is definitely worth the money.</p>


<p><strong>PROS:</strong> The perfect combination of affordable and comfortable. I almost always take a metro when traveling within the periphery of Sheikh Zayed Road.</p>

<p><strong>CONS:</strong> The problem, however, is the connectivity of the Dubai metro, which is largely limited to the city itself. I would have to look for an alternative if I wish to see what the UAE has to offer beyond Dubai. [Good news is that Dubai Metro is gradually expanding, so in the future, the connectivity will definitely improve.] </p>

<h3>Bus:</h3>

<div class="mb-4 mt-4">
<div class="text-center"><img alt="RTA Bus" class="img-fluid mt-3 mb-1" src="images/blog/blog-detail/bus.jpeg" />
<div class="text-center img-caption">RTA Bus | Photo by <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-ae/news/uae/dubais-rta-to-launch-9-new-bus-routes-on-april-7/ar-BBVwmUp" target="_blank">MSN News</a></div>
</div>
</div>


<p>Before you shy away from the idea of taking a public bus, you should know that just like the metros, buses in the city are clean and very comfortable.</p>


<p><strong>PROS:</strong> One word — inexpensive. And unlike metros, buses have an intercity route so you can travel between emirates. I also find the bus service in Dubai (and UAE in general) to be very pleasant — as the interior is very clean, and the fully functioning air conditioning just a perfect escape from the heat outside.</p>

<p><strong>CONS:</strong> Although buses may be the most financially apt choice, they are not necessarily the most convenient. For instance, there are only two locations where you can catch a bus to Abu Dhabi from Dubai; the bus goes to Abu Dhabi Central Bus Station and you will have to take a taxi/uber to get to your destination. I personally prefer to travel leisurely so buses are typically out of the question for me.</p>


<p><i>(Please note that you cannot pay cash on the bus. You must purchase the nol-card and top up with enough balance beforehand. For more on nol-cards please refer to the <a href="https://www.nol.ae/RtaPortal/Portal.portal" target="_blank">RTA portal</a>.)</i></p>


<h3>Taxi:</h3>

<div class="mb-4 mt-4">
<div class="text-center"><img alt="Duba Taxi" class="img-fluid mt-3 mb-1" src="images/blog/blog-detail/taxi.jpeg" />
<div class="text-center img-caption">Duba Taxi | Photo by <a href="https://www.dubai-online.com/transport/taxis/" target="_blank">Dubai Online</a></div>
</div>
</div>


<p>You will be taking a lot of taxi rides while in Dubai, especially during the summer months. It is not unusual to take a quick AED 12 (about $3.3) ride on a taxi to avoid a mere 500m walk in the scorching heat.</p>


<p><strong>PROS:</strong> Taxis in Dubai are comparatively cheaper than those in other metropolitan cities — Tokyo or New York for instance. I usually take a taxi whenever I am traveling to the outskirts of Dubai or whenever I go for groceries.</p>

<p><strong>CONS:</strong> Nonetheless, there is always an uncertainty of getting a taxi right then and there. You will sometimes have to contact Dubai Taxi and book a taxi, which could be troublesome if you do not have the local number. Also, this could be quite a hassle if you are tight on time.</p>


<h3>Uber/Careem:</h3>

<div class="mb-4 mt-4">
<div class="text-center"><img alt="Uber" class="img-fluid mt-3 mb-1" src="images/blog/blog-detail/uber.jpeg" />
<div class="text-center img-caption">Lexus Pick Up on Uber | Photo by <a href="https://www.dubai-online.com/transport/taxis/" target="_blank">Visit Dubai</a></div>
</div>
</div>


<p>Ride-hailing services are increasing their traction in the market. You will see promotions from the Dubai International Airport Arrival itself.</p>


<p><strong>PROS:</strong> The best part about using an uber is its convenience; just one click to book a ride of your choice to any destination. Traveling by road cannot get any easier than this — and also you travel in style. Even when selecting the basic options, more than 50% of the time, I have been picked up in a Lexus sedan.</p>

<p><strong>CONS:</strong> However, it is not the most budget friendly especially for long-distance travel. Taxis are generally cheaper although the price difference fluctuates.</p>

<h3>Car Rental:</h3>

<p>Renting a car could be a viable alternative if you have a driving license. You will have no trouble finding a car rental around Dubai. You will be saving some cash with a rental car if you are traveling long-distance. The only drawback of renting a car, I would say, is its taxing process — comparing rental rates from the pool of rental companies, going through their policies, and consulting with your vehicle insurance broker; even thinking about it is exhausting.</p>

<h3>New Solution in the Market</h3>

<p>Affordability, convenience and coverage — these are the factors that I look for in a transport service. None of the options that I have mentioned entail all three. Maybe the perfect transport is nothing but an unattainable fantasy. This is what I had thought until I was introduced to <a href="https://ekar.ae/" target="_blank">ekar</a> — a car-sharing app that lets you drive around the city in your preferred car at a reasonable price.</p>

<div class="mb-4 mt-4">
<div class="text-center"><img alt="Ekar" class="img-fluid mt-3 mb-1" src="images/blog/blog-detail/ekar.jpeg" />
<div class="text-center img-caption">Download the App to Get Started | Photo by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ekar.uae/" target="_blank">Ekar Instagram</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Using <a href="https://ekar.ae/" target="_blank">ekar</a> is as simple as it gets; download the app on your phone, locate and book an ekar in your vicinity, unlock it through the app, and voila, you are ready for the ride of your life. What’s more, you get unlimited fuel and parking spaces at zero cost. Isn’t that sweet!</p>

<p>Just to give you an idea: It previously cost me AED 400 for a round trip to Abu Dhabi; now I can rent an ekar for an entire day under AED 150.</p>

<p>The pricing structure is flexible — you could choose to pay on the basis of minutes, hours, days, or even weeks. The price is inclusive of taxes and insurance so there is absolutely no reason to fret about hidden costs; you are charged what you have been told.</p>

<p>With the ubiquity of <a href="https://ekar.ae/" target="_blank">ekar</a> around Dubai — and the middle eastern region — mobility restriction is no longer an issue. You can now travel every nook and cranny of the city, or the country, for that matter, as economically as possible without having to compromise on the comfort.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I personally prefer a combination of metro and taxi whenever I am traveling short distance — generally inside the Sheikh Zayed Road. Like I previously mentioned, getting around Dubai is not an issue with the existing transport options that are relatively inexpensive. The only time I face a travel hurdle is when I decide to visit areas that are located beyond the Sheikh Zayed Road. These places are completely cut off from Dubai metro links and the taxi bill generally ends up being expensive; using a metro is not an option while taking a taxi is not a financially sound move. This is where my appreciation towards the initiative taken by ekar stems from. It would not be an overstatement to say that ekar has helped make my long-distance trips stress free and truly delightful.</p>
